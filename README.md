# Facebook Camp Hackathon Submission Tool

A simple tool for our Camp Hackathon.

One nice thing, is no data is actually stored anywhere except for Facebook. 
The list of events is just whatever is made by the Facebook Page. 
Hack submissions are just wall posts for the events. 
Like counts are from FB. etc.
